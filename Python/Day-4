## **Easy**

Write a Python program to create a file named notes.txt and write "Learning Python is fun!" into it.
with open('notes.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Learning Python is Fun!")
***Output:Learning Python is Fun!***
---
Read the first 5 characters of notes.txt and print them.
with open('notes.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read(5)
    print (data)
***Output:Learn***
---

## **Medium**

Write a function `count_words(filename)` that returns the total number of words in a given text file.
def count_words(file):
    try:
        with open('notes.txt', 'r') as f:
            return len(f.read().split())
    except FileNotFoundError:
            print("File Not Found")
***Output:Learn***
---
Create a program that reads a file and writes its content into a new file named `backup.txt`, but in **all uppercase letters**.
with open('notes.txt', 'r') as source, open('bkp.txt', 'w') as bkp:
    bkp.write(source.read().upper())
***Output:LEARNING PYTHON IS FUN!*** in saperate bkp.txt file
---

## **Hard**

Given a CSV-like text file `scores.txt` with content:

```
Alice,85
Bob,92
Charlie,78
```

Write a script to calculate the **average score**.

Write a robust script that tries to open a file provided by user input. If the file doesn't exist, it should catch the **FileNotFoundError** and print a friendly message instead of crashing.
