## **Easy**

Write a Python program to create a file named notes.txt and write "Learning Python is fun!" into it.

with open('notes.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Learning Python is Fun!")
***Output:Learning Python is Fun!***

---
Read the first 5 characters of notes.txt and print them.

with open('notes.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read(5)
    print (data)
***Output:Learn***

---

## **Medium**

Write a function `count_words(filename)` that returns the total number of words in a given text file.

def count_words(file):
    try:
        with open('notes.txt', 'r') as f:
            return len(f.read().split())
    except FileNotFoundError:
            print("File Not Found")
***Output:Learn***

---
Create a program that reads a file and writes its content into a new file named `backup.txt`, but in **all uppercase letters**.

with open('notes.txt', 'r') as source, open('bkp.txt', 'w') as bkp:
    bkp.write(source.read().upper())
***Output:LEARNING PYTHON IS FUN!*** in saperate bkp.txt file

---

## **Hard**

Given a CSV-like text file `scores.txt` with content:

with open('score.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Alice,80\nBob,86\nRaj,78')
```
Alice,85
Bob,92
Charlie,78
```

Write a script to calculate the **average score**.

Scores = []
try:
    with open ('score.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            name, score = line.strip().split(",")
            Scores.append(int(score))
        avg = sum(Scores)/len(Scores)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File Not Found")

avg

***Output:81.33333333333333***

Write a robust script that tries to open a file provided by user input. If the file doesn't exist, it should catch the **FileNotFoundError** and print a friendly message instead of crashing.

filename = input("Enter filename: ")

try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found. Please enter a valid filename.")
